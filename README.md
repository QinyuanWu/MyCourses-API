# MyCourses-API

MyCourses is an application that allows a user (student) to search the CS courses catalogue and organize courses into three categories:

Taken: a course user has already taken (in the past)
Enrolled: a course user is currently taking (in the present)
Interested: a course user would like to take later (in the future)

This API focuses on the backend of the application.

Deployed on Heroku: https://mycourses-olivia.herokuapp.com
